# Mission Objective

</div>

---

### **Project description**

Mission Objective is a mobile app that gamifies daily routines
The user‚Äôs day appears as a map screen similar to a video game's pause menu with objectives plotted as markers (eg, "Eat lunch," "Go for a walk," "Finish task from calendar")
Users can complete, snooze, or start quests directly from the map, earning XP and tracking streaks

The app blends personal productivity with exploration mechanics and a cozy adventure-game aesthetic

---

### **Main goal**

Build a Kotlin-based Android app using Jetpack Compose that visualises daily tasks and calendar events as map-based "quests"
